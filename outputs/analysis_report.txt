CONCLUSIONS AND OBSERVATIONS:

1. BEST NORMALIZATION METHOD:
   - The minmax normalization method achieved the lowest average 
     reconstruction error across all meshes with an MSE of 0.00000039.

2. ERROR PATTERNS OBSERVED:
   - Quantization with 1024 bins introduces discrete approximation errors
   - Min-Max normalization tends to preserve absolute coordinate relationships well
   - Unit Sphere normalization is rotation-invariant but may introduce scaling artifacts
   - Per-axis errors vary based on the mesh's geometric distribution along each axis

3. INFORMATION LOSS:
   - The reconstruction error is primarily due to quantization (discretization)
   - Higher bin counts would reduce quantization error but increase storage requirements
   - Trade-off between compression and accuracy is evident

4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - For geometric accuracy: Use Min-Max normalization with high bin count
   - For rotation invariance: Use Unit Sphere normalization
   - Consider adaptive quantization for meshes with non-uniform vertex distributions

5. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR AI/ML:
   - Normalized and quantized meshes are suitable for neural network training
   - The error levels observed (0.00000039 MSE) are acceptable for most 
     3D learning tasks
   - SeamGPT-style systems can work effectively with this preprocessing pipeline
